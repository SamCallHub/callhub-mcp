## Endpoint Status by Category

### Agent Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|

| Delete Agent | deleteAgent | ✅ Tested | `/v1/agents/:id/` |
| Get Live Agents | getLiveAgents | ✅ Tested | `/v2/campaign/agent/live/` |

**Note:** Token-based agent endpoints (getAgentToken, getAgentDetails, updateAgentDetails, changeAgentPassword) were initially considered but determined to be unnecessary for the current implementation. These may be added in future updates if needed.

| Get Team | getTeam | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/` |
| Create Team | createTeam | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/` |
| Update Team | updateTeam | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/` |
| Delete Team | deleteTeam | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/` |
| Get Team Agents | getTeamAgents | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/agents/` |
| Get Team Agent Details | getTeamAgentDetails | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/agents/:agent_id/` |

| Remove Agents From Team | removeAgentsFromTeam | ✅ Tested | `/v1/teams/:id/agents/` |

### Contact Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Contacts | listContacts | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/` |
| Get Single Contact | getContact | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/{id}/` |
| Create Contact | createContact | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/` |

| Delete Contact | deleteContact | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/{id}/` |
| Get Contact Fields | getContactFields | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/fields/` |

**Note on Bulk Creation:** The createContactsBulk endpoint has a rate limit of 1 call per minute imposed by CallHub. Our implementation properly handles this limitation with informative error messages.

### Phonebook Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Phonebooks | listPhonebooks | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/` |
| Get Phonebook | getPhonebook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/{id}/` |
| Create Phonebook | createPhonebook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/` |
| Update Phonebook | updatePhonebook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/{id}/` |

| Remove Contact from Phonebook | removeContactFromPhonebook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/{id}/contacts/{contact_id}/` |
| Get Phonebook Count | getPhonebookCount | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/{id}/numbers_count/` |
| Get Phonebook Contacts | getPhonebookContacts | ✅ Tested | `/v1/phonebooks/{id}/contacts/` |

### Tag Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Tags | listTags | ✅ Tested | `/v1/tags/` |
| Get Tag | getTag | ✅ Tested | `/v1/tags/{id}/` |
| Create Tag | createTag | ✅ Tested | `/v1/tags/` |
| Update Tag | updateTag | ✅ Tested | `/v1/tags/{id}/` |
| Delete Tag | deleteTag | ✅ Tested | `/v1/tags/{id}/` |
| Add Tag To Contact | addTagToContact | ✅ Tested | `/v2/contacts/{id}/taggings/` |
| Remove Tag From Contact | removeTagFromContact | ✅ Tested | `/v1/contacts/{contact_id}/tags/{tag_id}/` |

### Custom Field Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Custom Fields | listCustomFields | ✅ Tested | `/v1/custom_fields/` |
| Get Custom Field | getCustomField | ❌ Issue | `/v1/custom_fields/{id}/` |
| Create Custom Field | createCustomField | ✅ Tested | `/v1/custom_fields/` |
| Update Custom Field | updateCustomField | ✅ Tested | `/v1/custom_fields/{id}/` |
| Delete Custom Field | deleteCustomField | ✅ Tested | `/v1/custom_fields/{id}/` |
| Update Contact Custom Field | updateContactCustomField | ❌ Issue | `/v1/contacts/{id}/custom_fields/{field_id}/` |

**Known Issues:** 
- The getCustomField endpoint consistently returns 404 errors, even for valid IDs. This appears to be a CallHub API issue.
- The updateContactCustomField endpoint has inconsistent behavior. We recommend using the updateContact endpoint with custom field values included to update custom fields.

### Webhook Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Webhooks | listWebhooks | ✅ Tested | `/v1/webhooks/` |
| Get Webhook | getWebhook | ✅ Tested | Custom implementation using list endpoint |
| Create Webhook | createWebhook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/webhooks/` |
| Delete Webhook | deleteWebhook | ✅ Tested | `/v1/webhooks/{id}/` |

**Note:** The getWebhook function uses a custom implementation that filters the listWebhooks response to find a specific webhook by ID, as CallHub does not provide a direct endpoint for getting a single webhook.

### Call Center Campaign Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Call Center Campaigns | listCallCenterCampaigns | ✅ Tested | `/v1/callcenter_campaigns/` |

| Delete Call Center Campaign | deleteCallCenterCampaign | ✅ Tested | `/v1/callcenter_campaigns/{id}/` |
| Create Call Center Campaign | createCallCenterCampaign | ✅ Tested | `/v1/power_campaign/create/` |

### Voice Broadcasting Campaign Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| List Voice Broadcasting Campaigns | listVoiceBroadcastCampaigns | ✅ Tested | `/v1/voice_broadcasts/` |
| Update Voice Broadcasting Campaign | updateVoiceBroadcastCampaign | ✅ Tested | `/v1/voice_broadcasts/{id}/` |
| Delete Voice Broadcasting Campaign | deleteVoiceBroadcastCampaign | ✅ Tested | `/v1/voice_broadcasts/{id}/` |

| Rent Number | rentNumber | ✅ Tested | `/v1/numbers/rent/` |

### User Management and Credit Usage Endpoints

|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Get Users | getUsers | ✅ Tested | `/v1/users/` |
| Get Credit Usage | getCreditUsage | ✅ Tested | `/v2/credits_usage/` |

### DNC (Do Not Call) Endpoints

| Endpoint | Function | Status | Endpoint Path |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|

| Delete DNC List | deleteDncList | ✅ Tested | `/v1/dnc_lists/{id}/` |

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Creation and Activation

Special considerations for agent endpoints:

1. **Agent Creation**: 
   - Requires `username`, `email`, and `team` parameters
   - Does NOT accept additional fields like first_name or last_name (API rejects requests with extra fields)
   - Does NOT accept a password parameter (agents set their own password during verification)
   - Created agents exist in a pending state until they verify their email
   - Pending agents are not directly manageable via the API

2. **Agent Activation**:
   - Implemented a browser automation workflow for activating agents
   - The API does not provide direct access to pending agents
   - The workflow includes:
     - Manual export of activation URLs via the UI
     - Processing the exported CSV
     - Using browser automation to visit activation URLs and set passwords

### Rate Limiting

The following endpoints have rate limiting imposed by CallHub:

1. **createContactsBulk**: Limited to 1 call per minute
2. **rentNumber**: Limited to a few calls per day based on account credits

Our implementation includes proper handling of rate limiting with informative error messages.

## Future Enhancements

1. ✅ **Team Management**: Implemented and fully tested
2. ✅ **Batch Agent Activation**: Implemented for handling large numbers of agents
3. ⏳ **Custom Field API Fixes**: Investigating alternatives for the problematic custom field endpoints
4. ⏳ **Campaign Creation**: Enhance the campaign creation tools with more templates and options
